# Simple Stack Based Buffer Overflow - Vulnserver
## This is a POC for a Simple Stack Based Buffer Overflow so that newbies on Information Security can practice Bufferoverflow with all necessary tools under one repo
I have used the Vulnserver software developed by StephenBradshaw and hosted on his [Github Repo](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver), which is also used on various Penetration testing exams and CTF's
### Pre-Requisite:-
    The Vulnserver runs in any windows, Windows 7 is recommended for smooth exploit
    The Exploit scripts runs smoothly in Python2.7, hence recommended to use Python while using the Exploit-Script
    Please change the Victim-IP in the script
